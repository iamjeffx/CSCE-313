\section{True/False}

{\bf 1.} UDP protocol deals with retransmitting packets in case they are lost in route.

{\bf Solution:}\\

False. UDP just sends out packets and doesn't really retransmit packets. 

{\bf 2.} TCP protocol is more heavy-weight because it maintains state information about the connection.

{\bf Solution:}\\
True. TCP stores the state of the connection and deals with issues that may arise if there are issues with the connection. 

{\bf 3.} Routing protocols are dynamic: they reconfigure under network topology change or outage automatically.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. Most routing protocols are dynamic and can adjust the settings and states based on the current condition of routers and connections. 

{\bf 4.} Domain Naming System (DNS) can be used for load balancing and faster content delivery.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. DNS facilitates faster access to domains by providing several IP addresses for a single host or domain name. This allows for traffic to go through multiple servers. 

{\bf 5.} The ping command is used to test whether you can make TCP connections with a remote host.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. The ping command simply checks if you can connect to a remote host, not if you can make a TCP connection with a remote host. 

{\bf 6.} The accept() function needs to be called the same number of times as the number of client-side connect() calls to accept all of them. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. 

{\bf 7.} HTTP protocol uses TCP underneath.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True.

{\bf 8.} Ports [0,1023] are reserved for well-known services (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, DNS, TELNET).

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. 

{\bf 9.} The master socket in a TCP server is used only to accept connections, not to run conversations with clients. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. The master socket accepts connections then redirects the client to other sockets to actually perform the conversations. 

{\bf 10.} A socket is a pair of IP-address and port number combination in both client and server side. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. 

{\bf 11.} For making a socket on the client side, the port number is chosen by the OS randomly from the available pool.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. 

{\bf 12.} A socket is like other file descriptors and is added to the Descriptor Table. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. Sockets have indices in the file descriptor table in UNIX systems. 

{\bf 13.} UDP is connectionless while TCP is connection oriented. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. 

{\bf 14.} The ping command is used to test network reachability.

{\bf Solution:}\\

True. The ping command tests whether a remote host can be connected to. 

{\bf 15.} The bind() function is used to set up a backlog of outstanding connections. 

{\bf Solution:}\\

False. The bind command associates a socket to a given port. 

\section{Short Answers}

{\bf 16. [20 pts]} Consider a disk that has 10 ms seek latency, 0.1ms rotational latency and 250MB/sec read speed. How much time would it take to read:

{\bf a. [10 pts]} One file size 1MB. 

{\bf Solution:}\\



{\bf b. [10 pts]} 100 files each of size 1 byte. Assume they are scattered randomly through the disk. 

{\bf 17. [25 pts]} A file system consists of disk blocks that are 32KB and pointers to blocks are each 16 bytes each. Each inode in this file system contains 10 direct pointers, 1 single indirect, 1 double indirect and 2 triple indirect pointers. Now, in this file system:

{\bf a. [10 pts]} What is the maximum possible file size?

{\bf b. [15 pts]} What is the overhead to represent this maximum-size file?

{\bf 18. [40 pts]} Examine the  Tannenbaumâ€™s solution to the Dining-Philosophers problem posted in the following: https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p415-sjoh/hw/project/dining-philosophers/index.htm.

{\bf a. [25 pts]} Rewrite the given solution in C++ using the semaphore class from our class lecture, make sure the program compiles and runs. Test the program and verify that it works correctly and show that using screenshots.

{\bf b. [15 pts]} Then, describe how this solution works and why it does not run into deadlocks.
